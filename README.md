## Fork

This for of LaTeX Image Helper package.

https://github.com/simon123h/latex-image-paste

The changes in compare to the original package:
* The scope of package has been extended to any gramma.
* The RAW path is inserted instead of latex-image block. This way it can be used in any schema, e.g. Python pyLatex package.
* The main path occur in path dialog now, so it can be changed in any moment without going to setting pane.
