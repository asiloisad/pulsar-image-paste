The image-paste package allows you to copy images or take screenshots and paste them directly into Pulsar. Here's how to use it:

## Installation

To install `image-paste` search for [image-paste](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/image-paste) in the Install pane of the Pulsar settings or run `ppm install image-paste`.

Alternatively, run `ppm install bacadra/pulsar-image-paste` to install a package directly from Github repository.

## Usage in text-editor

1. Take a screenshot or copy any image to the clipboard.
2. (Optional) Select text in the TextEditor. The selected text will be used as the proposed name in the next step.
3. Paste the image into the TextEditor instance. If the hack is activated, you can use the `core:paste` function (default `Ctrl-V`), or else use `image-paste:paste`.
4. Change the name of the image or accept the proposed name. Note that the `Image directory` path is prepended to the name.
5. Press `Enter`.
6. You will see that a directory including the file has been created, and a figure path has been inserted in the document.

## Usage in tree-view

1. Take a screenshot or copy any image to the clipboard.
2. Select a file or directory in the tree view. If multiple items are selected, only the first one will be used.
3. Paste the image. If the hack is activated, you can use the `tree-view:paste` function (default `Ctrl-V`), or else use `image-paste:paste`.
4. Change the name of the image or accept the proposed name. Note that the `Image directory` path is not prepended to the name.
5. Press `Enter`.
6. You will see that a directory including the file has been created, and a figure path has been inserted in the document.

## Notes

* If a file with the same name already exists, press `Enter` once more to proceed.
* The package supports all grammars, so it can be used in various file types, such as LaTeX, Python, and Markdown.
* Sometimes the copied item may have multiple formats (e.g., tables from MS Excel). In such cases, you can use `Ctrl-Shift-V` to paste raw text.
* Only `.png` and `.jpg` (also `.jpeg`) formats are supported. If the file extension does not match, the `.png` format will be used by default.
* The package works well with the [tree-view-clipboard](https://github.com/Souleste/tree-view-clipboard) package.
